	A simple driver for the parser in jplintphp.php you invoke
	this with a URL variable 'target' which is set to the file
	you would like to parse.

	A "fancy" version of jplintdriver.php which applies some
	formatting to generate a nice template to do reference
	documentation for a PHP script file.

	to database (as defined by db_jpgraph.sql)

    indexed documentation. This is a framework which needs
