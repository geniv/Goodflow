I needed a browser chat for my website, that worked semi-decent. I could not find one
anywhere so I looked on PSC. I found this:

http://www.planetsourcecode.com/xq/ASP/txtCodeId.169/lngWId.8/qx/vb/scripts/ShowCode.htm

I took that, and I totally transformed it. That code is included in the zip file, it is
"chat.php", this file is not needed for the chat to work.

Anyways, I took that, I divided it into two parts, a message part, and a view part. I took
the view frame and set a refresh rate on it. I had some friends help me to get it where I
could make it focus on the text input fiels, also I changed the text area to a text input
that way when you press enter it submits. I also added emoticons and a color pallete. You
are able to select what font you want and what color you would like it to be. I also made
it so that you can insert a link.

I also made a bunch of other improvements. This is not the same code as when I got it. I
hope that you get some use out of this. I am not taking all the credit for this code. I used
the base code:

http://www.planetsourcecode.com/xq/ASP/txtCodeId.169/lngWId.8/qx/vb/scripts/ShowCode.htm

and built from that. But I did do alot of the work by myself. I hope someone can learn from
this code, and maybe get some use out of it. Also, you may find other sources and stuff at
my website, http://www.gaming-havoc.com. If you use this code on your website could you
please maybe send me an email to show me how you used it on your site, and how you
integrated it into your site. That would be great.

ALL YOU NEED TO DO....
Upload this to your website, into a directory or something. CHMOD 777 the msg.txt file,
then to chat all you need to do is go to chatframe.php. That simple, it is installed.
